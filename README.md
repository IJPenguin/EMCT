# EMCT (Environment Monitoring and Conservation Tool)

## Overview

EMCT (Environment Monitoring and Conservation Tool) is a powerful computer vision-based solution designed to enhance the monitoring and conservation efforts of forests and wildlife sanctuaries. By using advanced image recognition techniques, EMCT identifies and alerts authorities about individuals carrying weapons or tools like guns, axes, and chainsaws, thereby helping in the preservation of animals and protected areas.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous surveillance of forest areas to detect potential threats.
- **Object Detection**: Identifies specific objects such as guns, axes, and chainsaws.
- **Alert System**: Sends real-time alerts to authorities upon detecting any harmful objects.
- **Data Logging**: Records and logs incidents for future reference and analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use and navigate through the data and alerts.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: 
  - OpenCV (Computer Vision)
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (Deep Learning)
  - Streamlit (User Interface)
- **Deployment**: Docker / Kubernetes for containerization and deployment
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud / AWS for scalable storage and computing
